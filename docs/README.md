# Introduction

Dagger is a cloud native service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as service endpoints (HTTP or GRPC) & managed databases (Postgres, InfluxDB,  Redis, & Elasticsearch). With Dagger, you don't need to write applications or manage resources. It can be scaled up to match the throughput of your data. If your data is present in Kafka, Dagger delivers it to the destination(SINK) that you specified.
