# Overview

This section talks a bit about some of the use cases that can be solved using Daggers with some examples.

### [Stream Enrichment] (https://github.com/odpf/dagger/tree/main/docs/usecase/stream_enrichment.md)

Enrichment of streaming Data with external more static Data sources is seamless in Daggers and is just writing a few configuration. We will explain this in more details with some example.

### [Feature Ingestion](https://github.com/odpf/dagger/tree/main/docs/usecase/feature_ingestion.md)

Realtime time feature generation is really important for online machine learn pipelines. Dagger can be a great tool for feature ingestion.

### [API Monitoring](https://github.com/odpf/dagger/tree/main/docs/usecase/api_monitoring.md)

Behind every great API is a reliable uptime monitoring system. But knowing/monitoring health of API metrics in real time is tricky. With Dagger this can be easily solved by writing some simple queries.
