Dagger or Data Aggregator is a cloud native framework for processing real-time streaming data built on top of Apache Flink and Kubernetes. With Dagger, you don't need to write custom applications or manage resources to process data in real time. Instead simple SQL on input Data stream does the job.

## Key Features
Discover why to use Dagger

* **Processing:** Dagger can transform, aggregate, join and enrich protobuf data in real-time.
* **Scale:** Dagger scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally for high performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
* **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to dagger with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones.
* **Pluggability:** Add custom bussiness logics in form puglins \(UDFs, Transformers, Preprocessors and Post Processors\) independent of core logic. 
* **Metrics:** Always know whatâ€™s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](./docs/assets/dagger-grafana-dashboard.json) of throughput, response times, errors and more.

To know more, follow the detailed [documentation](docs)
