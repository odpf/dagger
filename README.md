Dagger is a cloud native service for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as service endpoints (HTTP or GRPC) & managed databases (Postgres, InfluxDB,  Redis, & Elasticsearch). With Dagger, you don't need to write applications or manage resources. It can be scaled up to match the throughput of your data. If your data is present in Kafka, Dagger delivers it to the destination(SINK) that you specified.

* **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to dagger with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones.
* **Metrics:** Always know whatâ€™s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](./docs/assets/dagger-grafana-dashboard.json) of throughput, response times, errors and more.

To know more, follow the detailed [documentation](docs)
