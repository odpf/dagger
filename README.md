Dagger or Data Aggregator is an easy-to-use, configuration over code, cloud-native framework built on top of Apache Flink for stateful processing of real-time streaming data. With Dagger, you don't need to write custom applications or manage resources to process data in real-time.
Instead, you can write SQLs to do the processing and analysis on streaming data.

## Key Features
Discover why to use Dagger

* **Processing:** Dagger can transform, aggregate, join and enrich Protobuf data in real-time.
* **Scale:** Dagger scales in an instant, both vertically and horizontally for high performance streaming sink and zero data drops.
* **Extensibility:** Add your own sink to dagger with a clearly defined interface or choose from already provided ones.
* **Pluggability:** Add custom business logic in form of plugins \(UDFs, Transformers, Preprocessors and Post Processors\) independent of the core logic. 
* **Metrics:** Always know whatâ€™s going on with your deployment with built-in [monitoring](docs/reference/metrics.md) of throughput, response times, errors and more.

## What problems Dagger solves?
* Map reduce -> [SQL](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/table/sql.html)
* Enrichment -> [Post Processors](docs/advance/post_processor.md)
* Aggregation -> [SQL](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/table/sql.html), [UDFs](docs/guides/use_udf.md)
* Masking -> [Hash Transformer](docs/guides/use_transformer.md#HashTransformer)
* Deduplication -> [Deduplication Transformer](docs/guides/use_transformer.md#DeDuplicationTransformer)
* Realtime long window processing -> [Longbow](docs/advance/longbow.md)

## Running locally
Make sure you have Java8 and local kafka-2.4+ setup pre-installed on your local machine.
```sh
# Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/odpf/dagger.git  

# Build the jar
$ ./gradlew clean build 

# Configure env variables
$ cat dagger-core/env/local.properties

# Run a Dagger
$ ./gradlew dagger-core:runFlink
```
**Note:** Sample configuration for running a basic dagger can be found [here](/docs/guides/create_dagger.md#common-configurations). For detailed configurations, refer [here](docs/reference/configuration.md).

Find more detailed steps on local setup [here](docs/guides/create_dagger.md).

## Running on cluster
Refer [here](docs/guides/deployment.md) for details regarding Dagger deployment.

## Running tests 
```sh
# Running unit tests
$ ./gradlew clean test

# Run code quality checks
$ ./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest

# Cleaning the build
$ ./gradlew clean
```
